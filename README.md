# `Python`

Designed by `Guido Van Rossum`

`PEP 8`: `Python Enhancement Proposal` guidelines and best practices for writing clean `Python code`

1. `Python` is free, simple syntax, open source, powerful, and easy to learn.
2. `High-level interpreted` programming language ( Executes codes line by line)
3. [Object oriented](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Python/blob/main/oop.md): Object that holds the value and data type, the memory address is passed to the variable. 
4. `Dynamically` typed ( [Data type](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Python/blob/main/Data%20Types.md) of object is based on its `assigned value` | Dynamic data type )
5. Abundance of `libraries` ( [Pandas](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Pandas), [NumPy](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/NumPy), SciPy ) and `frameworks` ( Django, Flask )
6. `Portable` and `flexible` ( Anaconda, Jupyter, Terminal, IDE, Text Editor, Google Colab )
7. `Open source` with vibrant `community` support ( Stack Overflow, Videos, Medium )
8. Rich `documentation` ( Python and all the libraries i.e. builtin and 3rd party modules, submodules )
9. `Modularity`: Working in separate `modules`, helps to **focus** and make development easy and less error-prone.
10. `Reusability` of code, [module](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Python/blob/main/Importing.md), [function](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Python/blob/main/Function.md), [method](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Python/blob/main/Methods.md) and [class](https://github.com/KIRANKUMAR7296/Python/blob/main/class.md) 
11. `Applications`: Statistics, Data Science, ML, DL, AI, IoT, Web Development, Analytics, Automation.
12. Supports multiple programming paradigms, including `procedural`, `OOP` and `functional` programming.
13. Supports multiple platforms, including `Windows`, `MacOS` and `Linux` along with almost all `IDE's` and `text editors`
14. The only drawback is execution speed is `low` as compared to `C`, `C++`, etc.
15. Most popular due to active community, accessibility, flexibility, ease of use and wide range of applications.
